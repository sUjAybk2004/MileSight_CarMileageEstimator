# Car Mileage Estimator

This project is a web application that estimates car mileage using a linear regression model. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input car details and get a mileage prediction.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** A pre-trained linear regression model (`LinearRegression.pkl`) to estimate car mileage.
- **Web Interface:** A simple web application built using Flask.
- **CSV Support:** Includes a `train.csv` file for training and testing the model.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-mileage-estimator.git
   cd car-mileage-estimator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Input car details like weight, horsepower, number of cylinders, road type, and car age.
3. Click "Submit" to get the estimated mileage.

## Model

The linear regression model (`LinearRegression.pkl`) is trained using the `train.csv` dataset. For details about the training process, refer to `Backend.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The `train.csv` file contains features like car weight, horsepower, road type, number of cylinders, and car age. This dataset was used to train the linear regression model.
